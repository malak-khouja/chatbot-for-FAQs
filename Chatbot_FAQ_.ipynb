Antidepressants are divided into \\u201cclasses\\u201d based on what they do and which chemical messengers in the brain (called neurotransmitters) they are thought to influence. Each class may contain several different medications, which each have slightly different ways of working. Below, you\\u2019ll find common classes and examples of common medications. The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name. \\n SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex), and sertraline (Zoloft) \\n SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) \\n NDRIs or norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion (Wellbutrin and Zyban) \\n NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine (Remeron), which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant \\n SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone (Desyrel) \\n There are other classes of antidepressants (such as MAOIs or triclycics) that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don\\u2019t work. Other medications such as lithium, thyroid medication, or antipsychotics may also be prescribed, often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression\\u2014they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders. \\n Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants, keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process, especially when you feel unwell, but it\\u2019s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\\u2019s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. It\\u2019s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns\\u2014or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works.\",\n          \"What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects\\u2014this is normal and expected. However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \\n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. \\n Here are some common thinking traps: \\n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \\\"always\\\" or \\\"never.\\\" \\n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it\\u2019s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \\n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \\n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \\n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \\n I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \\n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \\n I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. \\n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \\n I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \\n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \\n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \\n Telling yourself how you \\\"should\\\" or \\\"must\\\" act. \\n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \\n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \\n Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \\n This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \\n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \\n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \\n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \\n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \\n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \\n Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \\n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \\n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \\\"I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\\\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \\\"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\\\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. \\n Ask yourself, \\\"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\\\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \\n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \\\"Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\\\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. \\n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \\n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: \\n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. \\n I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! \\n Labeling \\n 'Should' statements \\n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \\n It's okay to feel upset right now\\u2014there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \\n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \\n Check out Anxiety Canada's articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \\n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking.\",\n          \"Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \\n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17, 2018. Adults (over age 19 in BC) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality. \\n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \\n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \\n The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, formerly CARBC, is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information. The institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not.

side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people, and it\\u2019s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. everyone responds to them differently. it\\u2019s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns\\u2014or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works.\",\n          \"what you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do. sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects\\u2014this is normal and expected. however, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. you're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \\n these automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. you're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. you're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. \\n here are some common thinking traps: \\n thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. people who overgeneralize often use words like \\\"always\\\" or \\\"never.\\\" \\n i was really looking forward to that concert, and now it\\u2019s cancelled. this always happens to me! i never get to do fun things! \\n seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. people who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \\n i wanted to eat healthier, but i ate too many snacks today. this plan is a total failure! \\n saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \\n i made a mistake. i'm stupid! my boss told me that i made a mistake. my boss is a total jerk! \\n predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \\n i've been doing what i can to stay home and reduce the risks, but i just know that i'm going to get sick. \\n focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \\n i know there's a lot i can do at home, but i'm just so sick of this. everything is terrible. \\n believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \\n i feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \\n telling yourself how you \\\"should\\\" or \\\"must\\\" act. \\n i should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \\n here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. you can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \\n don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \\n this doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. when you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \\n ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \\n what is the situation? what actually happened? only include facts that everyone would agree on. \\n what are your thoughts? what are you telling yourself? \\n what are your emotions? how do you feel? \\n what are your behaviours? how are you reacting? what are you doing to cope? \\n take a look at the thoughts you've listed. are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? it's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \\n the best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. here are some ways to do that: \\n try to find evidence against the thought. if you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \\\"i can't do anything right! i must be a terrible employee!\\\" when this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \\\"is there any evidence to support this thought? is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\\\" you might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. \\n ask yourself, \\\"would i judge other people if they did the same thing? am i being harder on myself than i am on other people?\\\" this is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \\n find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. for example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \\\"good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\\\" to challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. \\n test your beliefs in person. for example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. if you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \\n once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. let's use the following example: \\n i feel sad and overwhelmed. i'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. \\n i'm the worst! i should be able to handle this! \\n labeling \\n 'should' statements \\n examine the evidence: i have a lot of challenges right now. i'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. i've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so i know i can do this. \\n it's okay to feel upset right now\\u2014there's a lot going on. i'm going to think about how i got through past situations and see what worked for me. i'm trying to do a lot on my own, so i'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \\n try the healthy thinking worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \\n check out anxiety canada's articles helpful thinking and thinking traps \\n this page is adapted from wellness module 8: healthy thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking.\",\n          \"cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. however, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. and, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. the negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \\n legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. the danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. cannabis is legal in canada as of october 17, 2018. adults (over age 19 in bc) are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. cannabis is regulated by the province of british columbia and will be sold through the liquor distribution branch. cannabis will be tested for quality. \\n when drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. this helps us manage the risks. however, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. it is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \\n the legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. when dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. but as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \\n the canadian institute for substance use research, formerly carbc, is a member of the bc partners for mental health and addictions information. the institute is dedicated to the study of substance use in support of community-wide efforts aimed at providing all people with access to healthier lives, whether using substances or not. for more, visit www.cisur.ca.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

antidepressants are divided into classes based on what they do and which chemical messengers in the brain called neurotransmitters they are thought to influence each class may contain several different medications which each have slightly different ways of working below you ll find common classes and examples of common medications the first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name ssris or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine prozac paroxetine paxil citalopram celexa escitalopram cipralex and sertraline zoloft snris or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors venlafaxine effexor and duloxetine cymbalta ndris or norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors bupropion wellbutrin and zyban nassas or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants mirtazapine remeron which can also be classed as a teca or tetracyclic antidepressant saris or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors trazodone desyrel there are other classes of antidepressants such as maois or triclycics that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions they are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don t work other medications such as lithium thyroid medication or antipsychotics may also be prescribed often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect antidepressants are not only used to treat depression they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants if your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication it can be a frustrating process especially when you feel unwell but it s important to find something that works for you side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people and it s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first everyone responds to them differently it s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works \",\n          \"what you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects this is normal and expected however when you interpret situations too negatively you might feel worse you re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term these automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time you re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad angry anxious depressed or stressed you re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you re not taking good care of yourself like when you re not eating or sleeping well here are some common thinking traps thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen people who overgeneralize often use words like always or never i was really looking forward to that concert and now it s cancelled this always happens to me i never get to do fun things seeing things as only right or wrong good or bad perfect or terrible people who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure i wanted to eat healthier but i ate too many snacks today this plan is a total failure saying only negative things about yourself or other people i made a mistake i m stupid my boss told me that i made a mistake my boss is a total jerk predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence i ve been doing what i can to stay home and reduce the risks but i just know that i m going to get sick focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive i know there s a lot i can do at home but i m just so sick of this everything is terrible believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation i feel scared and overwhelmed right now so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better telling yourself how you should or must act i should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills you can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www heretohelp bc ca don t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way this doesn t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap when you try and push upsetting thoughts away they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens what is the situation what actually happened only include facts that everyone would agree on what are your thoughts what are you telling yourself what are your emotions how do you feel what are your behaviours how are you reacting what are you doing to cope take a look at the thoughts you ve listed are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns it s common to fall into more than one thinking trap go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation the best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts use the evidence you ve collected to challenge your thinking traps here are some ways to do that try to find evidence against the thought if you make a mistake at work you might automatically think i can t do anything right i must be a terrible employee when this thought comes up you might challenge it by asking is there any evidence to support this thought is there any evidence to disprove this thought you might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently which doesn t support the idea that you re a bad employee ask yourself would i judge other people if they did the same thing am i being harder on myself than i am on other people this is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self criticism find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts for example you might have trouble with one of your kids and think good parents wouldn t have this kind of problem to challenge this thought you can ask other parents if they ve ever had any problems with their kids test your beliefs in person for example if you think that your friends don t care about you call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call if you assumed that they will all say no you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you once you have worked through some challenges try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps let s use the following example i feel sad and overwhelmed i m having a hard time figuring out what to do i m the worst i should be able to handle this labeling should statements examine the evidence i have a lot of challenges right now i m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly i ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past so i know i can do this it s okay to feel upset right now there s a lot going on i m going to think about how i got through past situations and see what worked for me i m trying to do a lot on my own so i m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together try the healthy thinking worksheet at www heretohelp bc ca check out anxiety canada s articles helpful

buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it cannabis is legal in canada as of october 17 2018 adults over age 19 in bc are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public cannabis is regulated by the province of british columbia and will be sold through the liquor distribution branch cannabis will be tested for quality when drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking this helps us manage the risks however it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system it is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold mildew or fillers that may be toxic the legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities when dealing with complex issues like cannabis policy no one has all the answers but as community members we all have thoughts feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use as individuals and communities in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm the canadian institute for substance use

antidepressants are divided into classes based on what they do and which chemical messengers in the brain called neurotransmitters they are thought to influence each class may contain several different medications which each have slightly different ways of working below you ll find common classes and examples of common medications the first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name ssris or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine prozac paroxetine paxil citalopram celexa escitalopram cipralex and sertraline zoloft snris or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors venlafaxine effexor and duloxetine cymbalta ndris or norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors bupropion wellbutrin and zyban nassas or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants mirtazapine remeron which can also be classed as a teca or tetracyclic antidepressant saris or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors trazodone desyrel there are other classes of antidepressants such as maois or triclycics that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions they are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don t work other medications such as lithium thyroid medication or antipsychotics may also be prescribed often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect antidepressants are not only used to treat depression they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants if your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication it can be a frustrating process especially when you feel unwell but it s important to find something that works for you side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people and it s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first everyone responds to them differently it s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works \",\n          \"what you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects this is normal and expected however when you interpret situations too negatively you might feel worse you re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term these automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time you re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad angry anxious depressed or stressed you re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you re not taking good care of yourself like when you re not eating or sleeping well here are some common thinking traps thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen people who overgeneralize often use words like always or never i was really looking forward to that concert and now it s cancelled this always happens to me i never get to do fun things seeing things as only right or wrong good or bad perfect or terrible people who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure i wanted to eat healthier but i ate too many snacks today this plan is a total failure saying only negative things about yourself or other people i made a mistake i m stupid my boss told me that i made a mistake my boss is a total jerk predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence i ve been doing what i can to stay home and reduce the risks but i just know that i m going to get sick focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive i know there s a lot i can do at home but i m just so sick of this everything is terrible believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation i feel scared and overwhelmed right now so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better telling yourself how you should or must act i should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills you can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www heretohelp bc ca don t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way this doesn t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap when you try and push upsetting thoughts away they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens what is the situation what actually happened only include facts that everyone would agree on what are your thoughts what are you telling yourself what are your emotions how do you feel what are your behaviours how are you reacting what are you doing to cope take a look at the thoughts you ve listed are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns it s common to fall into more than one thinking trap go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation the best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts use the evidence you ve collected to challenge your thinking traps here are some ways to do that try to find evidence against the thought if you make a mistake at work you might automatically think i can t do anything right i must be a terrible employee when this thought comes up you might challenge it by asking is there any evidence to support this thought is there any evidence to disprove this thought you might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently which doesn t support the idea that you re a bad employee ask yourself would i judge other people if they did the same thing am i being harder on myself than i am on other people this is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self criticism find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts for example you might have trouble with one of your kids and think good parents wouldn t have this kind of problem to challenge this thought you can ask other parents if they ve ever had any problems with their kids test your beliefs in person for example if you think that your friends don t care about you call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call if you assumed that they will all say no you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you once you have worked through some challenges try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps let s use the following example i feel sad and overwhelmed i m having a hard time figuring out what to do i m the worst i should be able to handle this labeling should statements examine the evidence i have a lot of challenges right now i m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly i ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past so i know i can do this it s okay to feel upset right now there s a lot going on i m going to think about how i got through past situations and see what worked for me i m trying to do a lot on my own so i m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together try the healthy thinking worksheet at www heretohelp bc ca check out anxiety canada s articles helpful

buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it cannabis is legal in canada as of october 17 2018 adults over age 19 in bc are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public cannabis is regulated by the province of british columbia and will be sold through the liquor distribution branch cannabis will be tested for quality when drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking this helps us manage the risks however it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system it is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold mildew or fillers that may be toxic the legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities when dealing with complex issues like cannabis policy no one has all the answers but as community members we all have thoughts feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use as individuals and communities in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm the canadian institute for substance use

well here are some common thinking traps thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen people who overgeneralize often use words like always or never i was really looking forward to that concert and now it s cancelled this always happens to me i never get to do fun things seeing things as only right or wrong good or bad perfect or terrible people who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure i wanted to eat healthier but i ate too many snacks today this plan is a total failure saying only negative things about yourself or other people i made a mistake i m stupid my boss told me that i made a mistake my boss is a total jerk predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence i ve been doing what i can to stay home and reduce the risks but i just know that i m going to get sick focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive i know there s a lot i can do at

likely to keep popping back into your mind ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens what is the situation what actually happened only include facts that everyone would agree on what are your thoughts what are you telling yourself what are your emotions how do you feel what are your behaviours how are you reacting what are you doing to cope take a look at the thoughts you ve listed are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns it s common to fall into more than one thinking trap go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation the best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts use the evidence you ve collected to challenge your thinking traps here are some ways to do that try to find evidence against the thought if you make a mistake at work you might automatically think i can t do anything right i must be a terrible employee when this thought comes up you might challenge it by asking is there any evidence to support this thought is there any evidence to disprove this thought you might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently which doesn t support the idea that you re a bad employee ask yourself would i judge other people if they did the same thing am i being harder on myself than i am on other people this is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self criticism find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts for example you might have trouble with one of your kids and think good parents wouldn t have this kind of problem to challenge this thought you can ask other parents if they ve ever had any problems with their kids test your beliefs in person for example if you think that your friends don t care about you call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call if you assumed that they will all say no you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you once you have worked through some challenges try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps let s use the following example i feel sad and overwhelmed i m having a hard time figuring out what to do i m the worst i should be able to handle this labeling should statements examine the evidence i have a lot of challenges right now i m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly i ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past so i know i can do this it s okay to feel upset right now there s a lot going on i m going to think about how i got through past situations and see what worked for me i m trying to do a lot on my own so i m going to talk to my family so

example if you believe that people don t like you thought you might avoid social situations behaviour and feel lonely feeling however cbt teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage a positive change in one factor changing a thought or behaviour can lead to positive changes in all factors cbt is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems including depression anxiety disorders eating disorders and substance use problems cbt is structured short term goal oriented and focused on the present it starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you next you ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts feelings and behaviours you ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future dialectical behaviour therapy or dbt is based on cbt with greater focus on emotional and social aspects dbt was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours dbt is an evidence based approach to help people regulate emotions it started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns particularly self harm key differences between cbt and dbt are validation and relationships dbt teaches you that your experiences are real and it teaches you how to accept who you are regardless of challenges or difficult experiences relationships are also very important in dbt including the relationships between you and your dbt practitioner you may have frequent check ins to talk about any successes or problems treatment may include a mix of one on one sessions and group sessions in addition to cbt skills you ll learn skills around managing your emotions building relationships with others coping well with problems or distress acceptance and

it causes problems for you or others and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations the reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems for instance if a person uses a substance to have fun only occasional social use may follow but when a person uses a substance to cope with a long term problem such as social

'how you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours when we feel stressed out angry or fearful it s hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have remember we all control our own actions and reactions no matter what s going on in the world we can call do something about this pandemic people often overestimate the negative parts their own feelings their own abilities to manage a difficult situation or the situation itself and underestimate positive parts their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones their support networks and opportunities how does the thought we re never going to make it through this make you feel it likely doesn t feel good and it isn t even true challenging negative unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood validate your ability to get through this and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well stop and notice thoughts that come up how do they make you feel do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively how can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation here are a few example i m so mad that my event was cancelled this sucks i know this is the safer option for everyone when it s rescheduled i ll enjoy it more because i won t have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness i hate spending so much time at home this is so boring i m doing my part to keep my neighbours safe it s worth it because it keeps people healthy i m having a hard time getting used to my new schedule this is so frustrating i ll get used to this soon just like i adapted the last time i had to change my schedule now that i m home more i ll have more time to finish the projects i haven t touched in months and i m excited to see the end results i m really scared and i don t know what to do i feel so overwhelmed right now it makes sense that i feel scared people are getting sick and we don t know when things will go back to normal but there are a lot of things i can do to keep healthy and i m going to do some research so i can do my best when i focus on the things i can do everything feels more manageable we re going to be stuck inside forever i m already sick of this i understand that it will take some time to manage covid 19 and i trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can i know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal the goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there s a problem instead this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now ': 80, 'how can i challenge thinking traps ': 81, 'what you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects this is normal and expected however when you interpret situations too negatively you might feel worse you re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term these automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time you re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad angry anxious depressed or stressed you re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you re not taking good care of yourself like when you re not eating or sleeping well here are some common thinking traps thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen people who overgeneralize often use words like always or never i was really looking forward to that concert and now it s cancelled this always happens to me i never get to do fun things seeing things as only right or wrong good or bad perfect or terrible people who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure i wanted to eat healthier but i ate too many snacks today this plan is a total failure saying only negative things about yourself or other people i made a mistake i m stupid my boss told me that i made a mistake my boss is a total jerk predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence i ve been doing what i can to stay home and reduce the risks but i just know that i m going to get sick focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive i know there s a lot i can do at home but i m just so sick of this everything is terrible believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation i feel scared and overwhelmed right now so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better telling yourself how you should or must act i should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills you can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www heretohelp bc ca don t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way this doesn t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap when you try and push upsetting thoughts away they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens what is the situation what actually happened only include facts that everyone would agree on what are your thoughts what are you telling yourself what are your emotions how do you feel what are your behaviours how are you reacting what are you doing to cope take a look at the thoughts you ve listed are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns it s common to fall into more than one thinking trap go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation the best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts use the evidence you ve collected to challenge your thinking traps here are some ways to do that try to find evidence against the thought if you make a mistake at work you might automatically think i can t do anything right i must be a terrible employee when this thought comes up you might challenge it by asking is there any evidence to support this thought is there any evidence to disprove this thought you might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently which doesn t support the idea that you re a bad employee ask yourself would i judge other people if they did the same thing am i being harder on myself than i am on other people this is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self criticism find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts for example you might have trouble with one of your kids and think good parents wouldn t have this kind of problem to challenge this thought you can ask other parents if they ve ever had any problems with their kids test your beliefs in person for example if you think that your friends don t care about you call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call if you assumed that they will all say no you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you once you have worked through some challenges try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps let s use the following example i feel sad and overwhelmed i m having a hard time figuring out what to do i m the worst i should be able to handle this labeling should statements examine the evidence i have a lot of challenges right now i m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly i ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past so i know i can do this it s okay to feel upset right now there s a lot going on i m going to think about how i got through past situations and see what worked for me i m trying to do a lot on my own so i m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together try the healthy thinking worksheet at www heretohelp bc ca check out anxiety canada s articles helpful thinking and thinking traps this

yourself you do not need a referral costs are not covered by msp but they may be covered by employee health plans a registered psychologist s fees charged by hour vary and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes you ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated the practical differences in how they work are not always so clear when it comes to your treatment and care the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals are you really focused on fine tuning medications are you looking for a particular therapy approach does the professional s philosophy of care make sense to you do you like the professional you re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences ultimately your relationship with the professional is what matters instead of focusing on designation look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations talk to your

someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy including registered psychologists registered clinical counsellors psychiatrists other therapists and counsellors family doctors psychiatric nurses and faith leaders it s useful to talk to someone about any problem a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better a professional therapist or counsellor can offer more they have training experience and emotional distance since they don t know you they use different theories to listen to you support you and approach different problems or patterns for example a psychotherapy called cognitive behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions well being and future thoughts and behaviours a therapist could help you learn and practice these skills there are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses a few examples include cognitive behavioural therapy interpersonal therapy dialectical behaviour therapy solutions focused brief psychotherapy narrative therapy and emotion focused therapy in general some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same no matter which approach you choose the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist s understanding of the problem and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist in fact one research review found that 50 of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor called non directive supportive therapy was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist 1 psychotherapy can and does work but the professional you choose and their match with your values is also very important when you re looking for a

cognitive behavioural therapy and dbt dialectical behaviour therapy are two forms of psychotherapy or talk therapy in both you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own cognitive behavioural therapy or cbt teaches you how your thoughts feelings and behaviours influence each other for example if you believe that people don t like you thought you might avoid social situations behaviour and feel lonely feeling however cbt teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage a positive change in one factor changing a thought or behaviour can lead to positive changes in all factors cbt is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems including depression anxiety disorders eating disorders and substance use problems cbt is structured short term goal oriented and focused on the present it starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you next you ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problem solving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts feelings and behaviours you ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future dialectical behaviour therapy or dbt is based on cbt with greater focus on emotional and social aspects dbt was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours dbt is an evidence based approach to help people regulate emotions it started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns particularly self harm key differences between cbt and dbt are validation and relationships dbt teaches you that your experiences are real and it teaches you how to accept who you are regardless of challenges or difficult experiences relationships are also very important in dbt including the relationships between you and your dbt practitioner you may have frequent check ins to talk about any successes or problems treatment may include a mix of one on one sessions and group sessions in addition to cbt skills you ll learn skills around managing your emotions building relationships with others coping well with problems or distress acceptance and mindfulness as with many talk therapies it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of cbt and dbt skills but once people master skills with support from your cbt or dbt therapist they often find

antidepressants are not only used to treat depression they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants if your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication it can be a frustrating process especially when you feel unwell but it s important to find something that works for you side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people and it s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first everyone responds to them differently it s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works ': 126, 'i received a diagnosis but i don t think it s right what can i do ':

to a trusted professional about the most common side effects call your pharmacist you can reach a pharmacist by phone after hours by calling 811 it s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider while it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better it s important to follow your doctor s instructions in some cases people can have an allergic reaction to a medication some reactions are not serious like a rash in these cases you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help after hours if you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing dizziness or confusion call 911 right away when you start a new medication your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects signs of an allergic reaction how long it might take to work and other information it s good information to keep on hand but it isn t always easy to read when you pick up your medication you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for if a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn t working for you there are many different options unfortunately finding the right medication can take some trial and error different people can have very different experiences with the same medication and often you need to try something to see if it works or doesn t work for you this can be a frustrating process especially when you want to start feeling better but it s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals but it s important to share information so you both understand what s going on and can make good informed

reservoir to hold the liquid a heating element and a battery to power the element the liquid is heated to become a mist inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream any residual vapour is exhaled vaping devices come in several types shapes and sizes referred to as e cigarettes vape pens vapes mods tanks or e hookahs vaping liquid e liquid e juice consists of a solvent usually propylene glycol or glycerol flavour and nicotine or cannabis though it may not contain anything in british columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products the number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years while vaping has increased e cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking the first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests it may help some people quit smoking evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco though less harmful than smoking cigarettes vaping still carries potential harms there is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour a carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine e cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands other chemicals flavourings and heavy metals present in vaping liquids have not as yet been well studied long term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined more research is needed in these areas marketing strategies for vaping products often on social media are designed to appeal to young people the range of flavours available especially those that are fruity and sweet and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and smoke in a less harmful way making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed each other in making good decisions about if when or how much to vape we offer not too much not too often and in a safe context as one way to think about using any substance what this means to you may be a place for talking to start the canadian institute for substance use research formerly carbc is a member of the bc partners for mental health and
